# Leishmania 
# Differential gene expression analysis
To understand how LP modulates host cholesterol metabolism, and if there is any species wide conservation that exist in this regulation, genome wide microarray expression data analysis was performed for already published dataset GSE64610 (PMID: 25376316) which consists of differential gene transcript expression profiles of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells infected with Leishmania major Friedlin V1 strain and Leishmania donovani 1S strain parasites; and GSE61211 (PMID: 26052705) which consists of differential gene expression between uninfected and infected U937 derived macrophages with  Leishmania braziliensis.
# Contents  
GSE61211 and GSE64610 folder contains ipynb file which consists of codes and the results folder contains the strains name inside of which there is text file and the figures- venn diagram, heatmap. The merge folder consists of the codes required for preparing the heatmap and venn diagram of 3 Leishmania species.
